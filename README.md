# CS50x 2026 Anki Deck (Weeks 0–10)

This repo contains an Anki deck I made while working through **CS50x (2026)** and using it as part of my interview-prep foundation.

The deck is organized by week (0 → 10) and uses a mix of:
- **Cloze** notes for key facts / definitions / step-by-step workflows
- **Basic (Q→A)** notes for conceptual recall and “explain it clearly” practice

I tried to keep it focused on the stuff that actually matters (and avoid trivia that just bloats reviews).
